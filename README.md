# Interview-Quiz
## Description

    I was tasked to make a mockup interview quiz to test myself and my peers. The purpose of this was so that I could practice more advanced JavaScript skills and I can build an idea of how some interviews would be.

## Installation
   On the first day, I primarily worked on setting up the repository and the HTML code. HTML, I added class tags buttons, and text for each section of the page, start page, question scoreboard, etc, On the second day I worked on all the JavaScript, and CSS, and debugged/linked all the CSS and JS. For the CSS the main thing was having certain code hidden till said otherwise by the JavaScript. Other than that installation it was used to make the webpage look nice and clean in addition to having the buttons look proper. After that, I started the JavaScript process. To start with I made it so that each time you clicked a button a different part of the page would appear for example, if you press start the start page would become hidden and the question screen would appear. Next, I created the questions which are at the top of the JavaScript. Thanks to my classmate telling me to put it in an object it saved me a lot of time from writing if, else statements. Lastly, I set up the timer on the exam and scoreboard.

## Challenges
    For the most part, I faced a lot of Challenges with JavaScript since it was my least experienced language. The most difficult part was setting the scoreboard and the timer. For the score board I was running into a bug that would not make it visible it took hours to find out and the problem was a typo because I put it within my submit section. For the timer, there was this bug in which if you got something wrong the timer would go down but go back up as if you never got it wrong which I was eventually able to fix because of the Xpert Learning Assistant after a lot of trial and error with the A.I.

## Usage

    The purpose of the website is to quiz yourself on JavaScript concepts so that it helps with your own JavaScript knowledge and to help with interviews as in some interviews the kinds of questions are likely to appear.
